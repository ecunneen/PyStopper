Welcome to PyStopper!

This is an open source program designed to allow musicians to practice stopping in randomly selected locations in their
performances.

To use:

1. Open the application.
2. Select the time that you will spend playing before you stop. Please note that the slider value is the maximum possible value forplaying time in seconds. The program will select a randomly chose time between 1 and the value of the slider. Ex. If you choose 10 seconds you will be playing for a time between 1-10 seconds.
3. Set the value for the time stopped. It works in the same way as the slider for time playing.
4. Hit the start button and begin playing!
5. When the square turns red stop immediately! This program won't work if you don't stop right away. This means you
could be in the middle of a run or a phrase!
6. Press the Stop button when you want to the program to stop cycling.
7. Command + Q to quit.
